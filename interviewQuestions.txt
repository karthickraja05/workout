Questions:

MySQL:

get second max value from table
But use in single sql query
Don't use max in your query

Assume its maths table 
id 	name 	marks
1	ajith	78
2	jack	76
3 	raja	89
4 	venkat	72

My answer: SELECT * FROM time ORDER BY ideal DESC LIMIT 1,1

PHP: 

one logic program

Find max repeated adjacent char in given char

Given $input = 'abcdabccbc';

Output is bc 
Because bc repeated 3 times in given str


My Answer: 

<?php 

$given_str = "abcdabccbc";

$n = strlen($given_str);

$array1 = array();
for ($i=0; $i < $n -1; $i++) { 
	$temp = $given_str[$i].$given_str[$i+1];
	$array1[] = $temp; 
}

$unique_arr = array_unique($array1);

$result_arr = array();

foreach ($unique_arr as $value) {
	$count = 0;
	foreach ($array1 as $key) {
		if($key == $value){
			$count++;
		}
	}
	$result_arr[$value] = $count;
}

$result_str = "";
$result_count = 0;

foreach ($result_arr as $key => $value) {
	if($value > $result_count){
		$result_count = $value;
		$result_str = $key;
	}
}


echo "'$result_str' is repeated ".$result_count." times";

I hope it will help you.
